# MachineLearning-MetalInsulator
Possible Metal Insulator Transition Compounds

This small github repository supports the work in the manuscript 'Machine-Learning Based Selection and Synthesis of Candidate Metal-Insulator Transition Metal Oxides'


The tools here build upon the work published in Chem Matter here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00905 

The pipeline here (preliminary_screening...) builds upon the tools which can also be accessed here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rpw199912j/mit_model_code/master?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/pipeline_demo.ipynb 

Our training dataset can be downloaded from the previous link, or can be found in an interactive manner here: https://mtd.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mit-classification-dataset/ 

We also attach three different metal-insulator transition compound cif structures, as relaxed using SCAN and the ground state magnetic structure identified in the SI.
